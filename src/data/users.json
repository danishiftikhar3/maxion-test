    "personal_essay": "i'm not really sure how to describe myself, because i consider myself pretty unique and dichotomous. i suppose work-hard / play-hard describes me pretty well: i take my career very seriously (i recently started working in management consulting), but i'm also a huge adventurer and willing (hoping?) to try just about everything.  i'm in the middle of my mba, and before the mba i had just returned to the us from a stint in the peace corps in central america, where i worked as a business development volunteer. i helped at-risk youth open and operate their own businesses through a business incubator, started a recycling co-op in my city with a marginalized community (i could talk about this forever), worked with hiv/aids support groups around the country helping them with income generation to help them support their families, and helped train women's groups in business skills. it was an amazing 2+ years and probably the most transformative experience of my life.  i consider myself an explorer and doer of cool things, including swimming the english channel and alcatraz and hiking a rain forest. on the list of future cool things to do: hiking the appalachian trail, biking across the us, scuba diving with great white sharks, hiking kilimanjaro, and trailing my family's ancestry in the basque region of spain.  even though i'm focused on business / consulting for my career, i'm really into the arts, and do a little bit of writing here and there myself (mostly just playing around with short story ideas, but i have a few larger projects i'm working on that i'm pretty excited about). i'm somewhat obsessed dante's divine comedy (and specifically the inferno), having read it about 20 times and always finding something new to obsess about.  i'm also somewhat of a musician: i've been a singer for a really long time and can play a little bit of guitar (though i usually let other people play and i sing). i've sung the national anthem at a celtics game and a minor league baseball game. the highlight of my singing career by far has been performing in front of about 130 people in an ancient roman amphitheater in caeserea, israel.  overall i'm a pretty big goofball and i love to make fun of myself. i love to make a fool of myself in karaoke, i'm the guy being a dork and having fun on the dance floor (though i know my way around a ballroom), but also have an arsty side and love museums, book clubs, ted talks, npr, bbc, talk of the nation, how stuff works podcast, stuff you missed in history class podcast, etc.",

    "personal_essay": "i was born in poland, raised in egypt, originally from bangladesh, went to high school in india and came to the us in 1996 from belgium. once here, i went to school in upstate ny and grad school in boston. in between that time, i lived and worked in danbury (ct), nyc, austin (tx), portland (or) and the bay area.  ask me a question and you'll always get an honest answer. i tend to wear my heart on my sleeve and my thoughts on my forehead. i love sf. i have a good core group of friends that i surround myself with. i am passionate about my work. for me, work-life balance is important. i believe in the 40/40/20 rule. 40% of time at work; 40% of time with my partner; 20% with my friends.  running is important to me but i don't expect my partner to be one. i generally eat healthy but i also eat everything. i am a foodie but not a food snob. i love to cook. i generally stay in on week nights and try catch up with friends after hump day. values, loyalty, honesty and kindness are important to me. i am a liberal, non-judgmental, trusting and someone who is comfortable in my their own skin. i don't like to give up on people and try help whenever i can.  i appreciate a nice glass of vino as much as my morning starbucks latte. on sundays, if i am not glued to football, i might go for a walk and wander around the city. i like to run and spinning couple of times during the week. waking up to the sun makes me happy. i am easy going and like to laugh a lot. i like to be spontaneous.  what i don't want in a partner: rude, dishonest, selfish, cheap and manipulative. i am generally playful and prefer someone who likes to share. after all, isn't that what we look for in a partner.",

    "personal_essay": "i'm a traveler and an adventurer.  i watch the stars. i adore the myths stored in constellations (know lots of them) and love listening to stories by a fire. a candle is sufficient.  i have a lot of energy, i will never get tired while doing something i really love, and it is sometimes quite worrying.. ;) and then, well, i'm also very lazy. the internal dialogue between discipline and indulgence surely is a hot one inside me. i'm not career driven and ambition is very low on my list even though i believe i am very successful. i grew up in italy, was in argentina in 2003 (i was also born there), in london in 2005, san diego 2008, nyc 2010, and sf right about now..  i have a dark sense of humor and i have barely found anyone that *really* disturbed me with twisted thinking or morbid remarks. i'm full of light, yet am healthily dialoguing with my darkness.  i have had many relationships with women and very few with men. i mean, if you're a guy, you'll agree with me, women are just better in many significant ways ;) but i've met pretty extraordinary people in my life and i know better than precluding options.  my mind is hyper-active and i now know that i'm also very instinctual. it is something that i've fought while growing up. i suppose i couldn't come to terms with the strength of instincts in general, and i focused on keeping control through my mind. i was smart and fed on it. considering that now i am well aware of my instincts and my strong power of intuition, i am after all glad that such denial happened early on since that helped me develop and attune my mind and heart, although fragility is still some kind of issue. i built a fairly strong armor when i was very young, probably cause i felt threatened without realizing it. the residue of that is my apparent tough cookie style. to most people, i am a lioness. and i kinda am. i can be strong as a goddess. and i can fight for a cause. i will give it all to win, and often will. but i'm not a big fan of this state of mind anymore. i can be a kitten, and often shy if i'm into someone. you'll see the lioness in me, once in a while (or everyday..). and that's ok. but i try to cherish my extremely big and scary tender side, as much as i can. after all, the easiest states in my nature are kindness and generosity. of the lioness sort ;) .  i can be very solitary. i have no problem spending a long period of time just by myself, and enjoy it. this often surprises people since when i'm in a group i often appear as a natural born socialite and leader. and, let's make it clear, if you can't appreciate contradictions and the magical ways in which they appear in life and in people.. i am not going to appreciate you.  my background is kind of chaotic (although it felt very natural and *earthy* to me). i shortly competed as an athlete (javelin and discus) when i was very young, i graduated at the conservatory and played in orchestras and chamber ensembles as well as solo performer. but then i quit the professional music career and graduated in theoretical physics. which i loved. but soon enough, after graduating and working as a researcher in rome for one year, i realized i felt increasingly suffocated by the air of control, superiority and \"fixation\" that i was surrounded with in that community. and, also, part of me was kind of like that. and also.. i was bored. so i went into a crisis, contemplated becoming a scientific journalist, then more options.. i was about to start a job writing tv shows but then finally landed on a phd in philosophy, in london. and that was a great decision, taken against all sorts of odds. take that, odds. now i'm training as a life-coach, while i teach at the university.  random tags: sushi eating, swimming in the mediterranean, skydiving, burning man, movie marathons, rocking the shit out of out rock band (pardon my french), gently teasing you, battling stereotypes, letting myself be moved by random stuff.",

(it certainly helped out in my trading career and poker playing.) i'm not easily influenced by other people's opinions, but i like to think that this is a good attribute. i tend to often say exactly what's on my mind in a matter-of-fact sort of way, without any sugar coating; many people would say i'm genuine. i have a very wide circle of acquaintances, but i prefer hanging out with a small group of close friends usually. i'm a bit of a social chameleon in that i can hang out with people of completely diffferent backgrounds and personalities. i am an intp on the myers-briggs personality type indicator, if that means anything to you.",

    "personal_essay": "i suppose i should be slightly more positive sounding.  i am a tomboy. this means i'm one of the boys. i wear mens pants because i find them more practical and comfortable. all my friends are men. if you are *interested* in me, then you must be ok with this. i am not the girlfriend who has a home-cooked meal ready for you when you get home. i will only do your laundry if i have to do mine and yours happens to be in the same hamper. i will never clean your mess. a lot of guys claim that they don't mind this but usually in the end it turns out that they do. i am incredibly vulgar, burp and fart loudly, sit with my legs apart, slouch, smoke endless cigarettes, and am covered in tattoos. i do a lot of shit talking and laugh at people in insulting ways. i *hate* flowers as gifts. i don't see the point of greeting cards.  if some feminine aspects must be noted, then i like pictures of insanely cute kittens. my hair is very long. i wish my boobs were bigger.  i find conversations about gross bodily functions hilarious, especially if they're gross and sexual at the same time. tmi is me.  i don't care about humankind in general. i have very few close friends and those few i treat as my family. i have countless casual acquaintances. apparently political beliefs are deal-breakers for most guys, so i will say this now: i do not follow any specific party, my world beliefs are very cold-heartedly fair. so if you're very strongly politically inclined and require your girl to be also, then you want to stay away from me. if you require your girl to deeply feel pity and sadness whenever there's a natural disaster, then you want to stay away from me. if you require your girl to donate to charities, you want to stay away from me.  i am bitter, jaded, grumpy, and overall a pessimistic person. if you require a girl who is cheerful and has a positive outlook on life like a ray of sunshine, then i'll just laugh at you.  i have spent a number of years dealing with alcoholics, stupid drunks, and otherwise intoxicated folk. this has given me extremely low tolerance for such habits. if you like to get wasted on a weekly basis, then i'm not going to like you. if you smoke pot incessantly, then i'm not going to like you. apparently all guys who have 80%+ match rates with me smoke a ton of pot. if you like to do hard drugs, then....  i am a night person. if you wake me up in the morning you will piss me off. i've held a variety of jobs, mostly in manual labor and customer service (funny, i know, i hate people). basically the point is to keep me away from a desk. i quit berkeley to avoid the desk. i really dislike the corporate job structure and how people behave within it. i don't care if you have it, but just know that i hate it and understand why i do.  i have a very cruel sense of humor where the more the person is suffering the more i laugh. especially if it's due to their stupidity.  i can give the cold shoulder and basically it takes a lot to break down my barriers, but once they're down then i will do a lot for you. i don't like to hug friends but i want my boyfriend to cuddle me as much as possible.  i don't show much enthusiasm, i don't like to give nor receive high-fives. i don't give compliments and i don't expect any. generally it is very difficult to apologize to me.  i don't have very high self esteem but i have high self-confidence. basically i know i lack in a lot of areas but i am fine with that, take it or leave it. i don't know why you'd be attracted to me in any way, but if you are then for christ's sake don't complain to me about how i don't smile enough.  my experience tells me that if a guy is too much like me then the relationship will fail. but for some reason i keep getting messages from guys with less than 60% match rates. this just tells me that they're just desperate for blowjobs. i definitely don't want a clone, but there's gotta be some basis of connection.",

(i sometimes carry a melodica or slide whistle on my person for this reason.) i like to dance, and i find that dancing is a lot like playing music. unfortunately, i'm not very good at dancing with other people (yet!).  i like to take photographs when i'm traveling to new places. it's kind of like making art, but without requiring all those pesky skills. oh, and did i mention i love to travel? especially by ship. (or airship, if it were possible.)  i believe that the best thing to do is to chill with other people. be it on the internet, in the city, at the beach, in a recording studio, on a bus tour around the south of france, or on a sofa watching british comedy, having a good time with good company is what makes life worthwhile.  i am laid-back, witty, and musical",

(lol) it was surprisingly kosher, actually. and this coming from a mild germ-aphobe. i am looking for a laid-back person who wants to go out, stay in, have fun, but isn't looking for something too serious or long-term, or time-consuming. if this sounds like you, than thank christ, because it has been forever. i just have this crazy notion that if two people are up front with their shit than they can both work something out that is safe, fun, and non-headache-inducing. prove me right!",

(:  first things first. i'm a musician above all things. i love piercings, tattoos, crazy hair. i love lolita, visual kei and oshare kei fashion. i rave. i dance and rap. i'm considered clinically insane by most individuals. i'm loud, and i don't intend on changing much about myself. i do a lot with my best friend, but i like going off on my own. i have a job. no car. so, enough about random tidbits, time for the big paragraphs~  i love music and i'm incredibly passionate about many things, and i'm looking for someone to share my interests with. i love to talk, so feel free to talk to me. anything you want to know you can; i'm an open book (: my life has been crazy and hectic and i tend to move around a lot out of habit, and my goal in life is to travel and see the world. i currently live with my best friend in our own apartment. i am very much attached to music, and i play guitar, bass, piano and drums. i love to sew and enjoy making my own clothing, and i love to do people's hair and makeup. i am fluent in japanese and french, and i'm learning korean. i love sushi and i avoid meat. i am fascinated with world religions and cultures and i tend to research them on my spare time. i absolutely love hot springs and would love to visit colorado in order to enjoy them. i am incredibly open and i love to hear about new things and try them. (:  i write a lot, usually lyrical poems or short stories incorporating characters i've created. i love to cosplay and sew my own outfits. i think corsets are sexy and i like to wear collars. i make up songs in my sleep, i daydream the most fantastic scenarios, and i'm bubbly and sometimes too much to handle. i'm low maintenance and easygoing, and fairly independent. i don't have a car because i love pt a little too much. i plan on getting one in the future and weaning myself off of pt. :p i love piercings but think certain ones are simply grotesque. i'm a bit territorial, and i don't share. so if you're looking for someone to join a threesome, or some type of swinging relationship, don't bother messaging me. i'm not into that and i never will be.  i love reading, and i love old disney movies. i have yet to truly grow up, and i don't generally watch tv, unless its boomerang or nicktoons. i love to wake up on a saturday morning, make myself some strawberry milk and chai tea, and sit down and watch invader zim, powerpuff girls or old pokemon. i watched the tex avery show and mgm when i was growing up and i love it still. i hate the bull they put on tv nowadays, which is why i generally avoid watching it. i swear like a sailor, i love swingsets, and i get completely engrossed in nature. i love hummingbirds, and frogs. i tend to be fairly boyish, and alternate between dressing like a guy and dressing like i'm colorblind, crazy and dressed in the dark. i love learning about people and i keep other people's secrets well but don't tend to have my own. camping and the beach are amazing. (:  i plan on staying in the bay for a while. i love to rave, but i don't do drugs. i love to stay up all night talking to someone. i'm generally a happy person, so i'd love to see you make me smile (:  i don't really do drugs, but i do smoke on the occasion. i have a colorful, wide vocabulary and send most people's heads spinning because of it. i hate people who can't type. i'm a bit of a grammar nazi, but i do it in good taste and kind intention. i love dying my hair and i'm getting snakebites and my tongue pierced fairly soon. the only family i have left is my father, but i'm independent. i can't wait to get out and see the world, and i want someone to share it with. (:  i have self confidence. i hate dating people who don't. who don't. sorry. if you don't have the least bit of self confidence then it's not going to go far between us. i'm not a 'butch', nor am i a 'lipstick lesbian'. i'm somewhere between the two. i prefer females but like both genders. whatever your religious preference is fine by me, but i'll point out the fact that i am wiccan, and i do practice. i won't shove my beliefs down your throat, and all i ask is you respect mine as well. i'm incredibly respectful to parents and friends until they disrespect me. i don't tolerate people who disrespect my friends without reason, and my father at all. i'm daddy's little girl, and always have been. i'm the girl you see driving down the road with my arms covered in kandi, my hair spiked, my makeup crazy, blasting music from the lion king and screaming the lyrics at the top of my lungs. i'm insane like that. i'm sorry if it's not your style, but it's definitely mine.  want to know more? message me. i'll give you my number anytime, let's chat.

    "personal_essay": "i recently moved to novato and am enjoying watching the turkeys and deer out my home office window. turkeys were raising a ruckus this morning when i woke up and i can't wait to see baby critters. major plus is now i have a 15 minute roundtrip commute to get to work, rather than a two-hour one.  i still am attracted to a flexible, intelligent mind full of curiosity and humor.  i am no longer 18, or 40 or 50 and at the mercy of hormones. what does that mean? while chemistry is very important, enjoying a man's company comes first these days. if physical attraction follows, that's peachy, too.  i don't believe in taking anything too seriously. it makes me happy to know that there is always something new to learn, and that there is a never-ending supply of books, music, and words. currently i work for an insurance company, but i've also been a freelance writer/graphic designer/poet and continue to write and explore creative outlets. once i worked for a marketing firm that toured the hanna-barbera cartoon characters. the three years i spent working for a hospice changed my life.  editing, producing, and publishing a literary magazine for a wonderful year was rewarding and a lot of fun. pangolin featured poetry, art, music, and short, short stories. performance events celebrated each issue, combining the talents of the musicians, dancers, writers, and artists who contributed.  curiosity about nearly everything motivates much of what i think about and do. if you surprise me with your ideas and ways of thinking and being, you will find a friend for life. we could take a long walk and talk about it.  i'm not the same woman i was yesterday, or a year ago. continuing to learn and grow as a human being makes life worth living.",

' be strong and of a good courage.' act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes. . . . if death ends all, we cannot meet death better.  education: chemistry and math profession: environmental consultant.",

    "personal_essay": "updated 25 feb 2012.  based on other people's profiles, i have a tremendous amount of text here, and i fully realize that most of you will not read it all. however, i urge you to read the results of my cacoethes scribendi. i've put a lot of energy and thought into my profile.  to attempt to synopsize, i'm a 29 year-old with a passion for words and education. i have an affinity for electronics. i am also very enthusiastic and open about sex. i love music, and usually have some playing whenever possible.  i am currently madly in love with jaindowe, and i'm lucky enough that she returns the feeling. we are nonmonogamous, and she consistently blows my mind with how amazing she is.  i have a lovable ball of black and white fur with boundless energy and a taste for feathers. her name is trixie - short for \"venatrix,\" which is latin for \"huntress\" - and she is the cutest kitten on the entire planet.  the more i watch her around other people, the more i realize that i am her human, as much as she is my cat. she deigns demand food from others or stand still for one or two pets. for me, she sits on my shoulders and purrs. she snuggles up near me in bed at night and follows me around during the day. she mewls piteously when i leave in the morning and greets me at the door when i return home. truly, our meeting was fortuitous, and my life would be poorer without her.  a more in-depth description of various facets of my personality:  i am a writer. i think in words, and am fairly skilled in their use, written or spoken, to communicate ideas. i write various types of short fiction and essay. i post most of my writing to my personal website. in keeping with my love of words, i have a bit of a lexical fascination: i love obscure words, long words, and strange words. message idea: what's your favorite word?  i used to be libertarian, but then i grew out of my college-freshman arrogance and greed. i would now consider myself a social liberal and progressive, but favoring social capitalism as an economic policy. i used to be a strong laissez-faire capitalist until i realized that the american deification of capitalism is probably not wise or good in the long run. fiduciary duties and duties of care do not go together in systemic providers such as health care and education.  i was, and am, ignostic. i feel that the impossible question of god's existence is preceded by an equally impossible question of god's identity. however, these questions notwithstanding, i consider myself atheist.  i am a rabid empiricist. rational thought and the scientific method has advanced human endeavor in nearly innumerable ways. i am an enthusiastic naturalist, and identify as a bright.  philosophically, i am a physicalist, a naturalist, a monist, and a realist.  i am quite dominant, though i'm not particularly rude or domineering about getting my way in everyday social interactions. i'm moderately sadistic, though if one looks at my long-term relationships, one might conclude that i'm emotionally masochistic.  i'm extremely exhibitionist. i love to be watched, whether i'm being sexual, doing daily activities, or even sound asleep.  i used to be polyamorous, then i was a swinger, now i'm not sure what i am. i know that much of my life's search has been devoted to finding someone with whom i can partner, someone who is my complement. i am not sure that i will ever find such a person, should she or he even exist. in the mean-time, i seek a relationship that is open, honest, passionate, and joyful.  on the suggestion of zasu12, the shorter, less serious version of the above is: i am not polyamorous. nor am i monamorous. i do not tend towards any style of relationship inherently. what i am is happyamorous. i seek relationships that are happy, and make all participants happy. so, be happy. or be trying, anyway. i am.  i have been down the relationship path a few times now. there are a few commonalities:  when i love, i love completely. i overlook flaws or personality incompatibilities, no matter how egregious.  once i have fallen in love with someone, i do not stop loving them, ever. i could name every woman i have truly loved, and still say with perfect honesty that i love them.  i do not tend to fall love quickly. this is not to say that i am not passionate at the beginning of a relationship; only that it takes a while for passion to develop into what i would call love.  i tend to fall in love with people who are unavailable to me, for one reason or another. i recognize this is a bad thing, and i'm working on it.  when i say, \"i love you,\" for the first time, it will always be in person.  i am a highly sexual person, and this is another field in which i've been down the path quite a few times. i've had numerous partners, and pretty much every fantasy i can realistically expect to fulfill, i've fulfilled. curiously enough, this has resulted in a very laid-back attitude towards sex, in general. if it happens, i enjoy it immensely, but i'm not nearly as focused on it as one might think, given my history. whether or not we can sleep next to each other and feel rested in the morning is much more indicative of compatibility and trust than the expertise with which we can trade orgasms.  the more i have explored, the more i think i may be bisexual, but it's an avenue i have not felt compelled to explore, yet. maybe heteroflexible is the best word to use here?  since being out of college and underemployed, i've been experimenting with body-building. the more i work at it, the more i understand that real career bodybuilders are another manifestation (perhaps a more masculine, testosterone-fueled one?) of anorexia nervosa. all the really \"successful\" ones say the same things: that no matter how much they work on their body, no matter how massive and ripped they get, there are always imperfections, and they train for basically their entire waking life to remove these tiny imperfections. now that i'm employed full-time again, i've cut back on the working out, mostly happy with how i look.  i am myopic and esophoric, meaning i can not function effectively without my glasses. while either eye surgery or contact lenses could correct the myopia, the esophoria is a neuromuscular condition and must be externally corrected. the progress of the disorder appears to have been arrested by the prismatic lenses i wear, but it may resume degenerating at any time. i savor every second i can see clearly.  i am transhumanist. having mitigated natural selection's influence on our species to nearly zero, we must now replace it with our own actions if we wish to advance. feel free to ask me about it.  i am passionate and informed about the growing global energy crisis. fossil fuel production is peaking, but renewable sources of energy are not being implemented in sufficient quantities or at sufficient speeds to meet current demand for energy, let alone the rapidly growing hunger we currently exhibit. the future of technological civilization is at risk, and no one seems willing to discuss it. global climate change is obviously a huge part of this. ask me more.  i am likewise very passionate about intellectual property law. copyright and patents are broken in fundamental (though different) ways in our legal system, and it stifles innovation and art in ways both subtle and gross. i support movements like copyleft and open-source. i donate to the eff. and yes, i use linux wherever possible. ask me more.  i understand generative grammars.  i do not really like riddles. they generally revolve around hiding one or more crucial pieces of information by either leaving it out completely or using obtuse language, and are thus fairly boring. a good problem, on the other hand, can captivate me for hours. examples of those include the hundred prisoner problem and the green-eyed guru. ask me more, or propose another problem.  i've been told by various people in my life that i can be abrasive in my interpersonal interactions. i'm working on it, but you have fair warning.  one way this manifests is sarcasm. i am very frequently sarcastic. i have a very dry, cynical, and snarky sense of humor. with friends and family, i will frequently engage in a social game i call \"sarcasm chicken.\"  i have a fairly good memory for conversations; i can often repeat conversations nearly verbatim from weeks or months ago. however, i am absolutely terrible at matching faces with names at first. i attach names as signifiers to personalities, not to appearances. until i get to know you, i will forget your name. frequently. sorry.  i love diet coke.  i value honesty and bravery highly, and correspondingly, i despise deceit and cowardice. if you want to impress me, stand up for your principles, keep your promises, and tell hard truths. if you habitually dissemble or equivocate, i'm really not interested.  my journal can be found here. it is a very good way to get to know about me, other than, well, talking to me. you will need to register (and request access) to see much of the \"juicy stuff.\" please note, this is not my okcupid journal, which i use mainly to kvetch about okcupid's attempt to break each and every feature i like or about a particular match questions's meaninglessness, in the ayersian sense.  above all, i believe that happiness is something you make, not something you have. despite the hurts i have been given, earned or unearned, i make an effort every minute of every day to be happy.  i am sardonic, concupiscent, and callipygian.",
